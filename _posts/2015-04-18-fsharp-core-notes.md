## General Guidance 

### Application v. Library v. Script

Each project is either an *application* or a *library*.

* Examples of application are `.exe` project or a `.dll` project that is a test project, addin, website, or an app.

* Libraries are just ordinary `.dll` components (excluding those above which are applications). 

* Scripts are not projects, just `.fsx` files, possibly referring to other files using `#load` and Libraries using `#r`

### Do *not* bundle FSharp.Core with a library 

Do _not_ include a copy of FSharp.Core with your library or package.  If you do, you will create havoc for users of
your library.

The decision about which `FSharp.Core` a library binds to is up to the application hosting of the library.
The library and/or library package can place constraints on this, but it doesn't decide it.

Especially, do _not_ include FSharp.Core in the ``lib`` folder of a NuGet package.


### Deploy FSharp.Core as part of an application

For applications, FSharp.Core is normally part of the application itself (so-called "xcopy deploy" of FSharp.Core).  

For modern tempaltes, this is the default. For older templates, you may need to use ``<Private>true</Private>`` in your project file. In  Visual Studio this is equivalent to setting the `CopyLocal` property to `true` properties for the `FSharp.Core` reference.

FSharp.Core.dll will normally appear in the `bin` output folder for your application. For example:

```
    Directory of ...\ConsoleApplication3\bin\Debug
    
    18/04/2015  13:20             5,632 ConsoleApplication3.exe
    18/04/2015  13:20               187 ConsoleApplication3.exe.config
    14/10/2014  12:12         1,400,472 FSharp.Core.dll
```

## Always reference FSharp.Core via the NuGet package.

FSharp.Core is now always referenced via [the NuGet package](http://www.nuget.org/packages/FSharp.Core). 

Some templates for F# libraries use an **implicit** FSharp.Core package reference where the .NET SDK chooses one, e.g. [this kind of thing](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/pull/4327/files#diff-2cc8401da83ac111dbadcb8fb435075eR35).  You should generally use an **explicit** reference, especially when creating libraries.

If you are using an old-style project file, see the information further below.

If using new-style .NET SDK project files, use:

    <PackageReference Update="FSharp.Core" Version="4.2.3" />


### FSharp.Core is binary compatible

FSharp.Core is binary compatible across versions of the F# language. For example, FSharp.Core `4.0.0.0` (F# 2.0) is binary compatible with  `4.3.0.0` (F# 3.0), `4.3.1.0` (F# 3.1), `4.4.0.0` (F# 4.0) , `4.4.1.0` (F# 4.1), , `4.4.3.0` (F# 4.1+)  and so on.

Likewise, FSharp.Core is binary compatible from "portable" and "netstandard" profiles to actual runtime implementations. For example, FSharp.Core  for `netstandard1.6` is binary compatible with the runtime implementation assembly `4.4.3.0` for .NET Core and .NET Framework apps.

Binary compatibility means that a component built for X can instead bind to Y at runtime.
It doesn't mean that Y behaves 100% the same as X (some bug fixes may have been made, and Y may have more functionality than X).

### Libraries should target lower versions of FSharp.Core

F# ecosystem libraries should generally target the *earliest, most portable* profile of FSharp.Core feasible, within reason.

If your library is part of an ecosystem, it can be helpful to target the _earliest, most widespread language version_ 
and the _earliest_ and _most supported_ profiles of the .NET Framework feasible.

As of February 2018 new editions of F# libraries should generally do the following:
* Be `netstandard1.6`, or `netstandard2.0` with an additional .NET Framework 4.5 (`net45`) build
* Use FSharp.Core nuget 4.2.3 (assembly version 4.4.1.0) or 4.3.3 (assembly version 4.4.3.0)

You should no longer to make your library a PCL "Portable" component. They are deprecated.

For personal libraries, or libraries that are effectively part of an application, the choice is yours, just target
the latest language version and the framework you're using in your application.


### Applications target higher versions of FSharp.Core

F# applications should generally use the *highest* language version and the most *platform-specific* version of FSharp.Core.

Generally, when writing an application, you want to use the highest version of FSharp.Core available for the platform
you are targeting.

If your application in being developed by people using multiple versions of F# tooling (common
in open source working) you may need to target a lower version of the language and a correspondingly earlier version
of FSharp.Core.


## FSharp.Core version and NuGet  package numbers

See [the F# version information RFC](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design/blob/master/tooling/FST-1004-versioning-plan.md).


Main .NET Framework DLLs (used at runtime for applications on .NET 4.x):

|         |                 |   Version  | Nuget |
|:-------:|:---------------:|:-----------|:------|
| F# 2.0  | .NET 4.0+       |   4.0.0.0  |       |
| F# 3.0  | .NET 4.0+       |   4.3.0.0  | [3.0.2](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FSharp.Core/3.0.2) |
| F# 3.1  | .NET 4.0+       |   4.3.1.0  | [3.1.2.5](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FSharp.Core/3.1.2.5) |
| F# 4.0  | .NET 4.5+, pcls       |   4.4.0.0  | [4.0.0.1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FSharp.Core/4.0.0.1) |
| F# 4.1  | .NET 4.5+, netstandard1.6+       |   4.4.1.0  | [4.2.3](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FSharp.Core/4.1.1.18) |
| F# 4.1x | .NET 4.5+, netstandard1.6+       |   4.4.3.0  | [4.3.3](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FSharp.Core/3.0.2) |



### Use Binding Redirects for Applications

If applications use library components that reference an earlier FSharp.Core, then they may need binding redirects
to specify that those libraries should bind to the actual FSharp.Core used as part of the application.

An `app.config` is used to specify binding redirects. It is normal to redirect all lower versions of FSharp.Core to 
the version actually being used.  For example, to redirect all versions of FSharp.Core up to 4.3.0.0 to use 4.3.1.0:

```
        <dependentAssembly>
          <assemblyIdentity name="FSharp.Core" publicKeyToken="b03f5f7f11d50a3a" culture="neutral" />
          <bindingRedirect oldVersion="0.0.0.0-4.4.1.0" newVersion="4.4.3.0" />
        </dependentAssembly>
```

This is located in a section of the app.config like this:

```
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
    <configuration>
        ...
        <runtime>
          <assemblyBinding xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1">
            <dependentAssembly>
              <assemblyIdentity name="FSharp.Core" publicKeyToken="b03f5f7f11d50a3a" culture="neutral" />
              <bindingRedirect oldVersion="0.0.0.0-4.4.1.0" newVersion="4.4.3.0" />
            </dependentAssembly>
          </assemblyBinding>
        </runtime>
    </configuration>
```

Application project files should normally also specify `AutoGenerateBindingRedirects` which allows tooling to 
help keep the binding redirects up-to-date, see below.

### FSharp.Core in F# Interactive

F# Interactive (`fsi.exe`) always references and uses the FSharp.Core of the corresponding tool chain, as follows:

- F# 3.0 --> 4.3.0.0
- F# 3.1 --> 4.3.1.0
- F# 4.0 --> 4.4.0.0
- F# 4.1 --> 4.4.1.0
- F# 4.1+ --> 4.4.3.0

F# Interactive can load PCL assemblies that reference compatible FSharp.Core

### FSharp.Core and static linking

The ILMerge tool and the F# compiler both allow static linking of assemblies including static linking of FSharp.Core.
This can be useful to build a single standalone file for a tool.

However, these options must be used with caution. 

* Only use this option for applications, not libraries. If it's not a .EXE (or a library that is effectively an application) then don't even try using this option.

* Prior to F# 4.0, static linking could not be used for F# assemblies which use quotation literals.  Even for F# 4.0
  static linking can only be used for F# assemblies compiled with F# 4.0 and referencing at least FSharp.Core 4.4.0.0
  (or a corresponding portable profile for FSharp.Core).

Searching on stackoverflow reveals further guidance on this topic.


### FSharp.Core in components using FSharp.Compiler.Service

If your application of component uses FSharp.Compiler.Service, 
see [this guide](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Compiler.Service/corelib.html). This scenario is more complicated
because FSharp.Core is used both to run your script or application, and is referenced during compilation.

Likewise, if you have a script or library using FSharp.Formatting, then beware that is using FSharp.Compiler.Service.
For scripts that is normally OK because they are processed using F# Interactive, and the default FSharp.Core is used.
If you have an application using FSharp.Formatting as a component then see the guide linked above.

### Making .NET Standard 1.6 and 2.0 libraries

.NET Standard library binaries can be shared and used in all modern .NET implementations.  Where possible
you should make your library a .NET Standard 1.6 or 2.0 component.  For example, when using a new-style F# project file
just use:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <Compile Include="Library.fs" />
    <PackageReference Update="FSharp.Core" Version="4.2.3" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

You can multi-target to produce both .NET 4.5 and .NET Standard 2.0 versions of your library like this:

    <TargetFrameworks>netstandard2.0;net45</TargetFrameworks>

### Do *not* assume FSharp.Core is in the GAC

In compiled applications, you should never assume that 
FSharp.Core is in the GAC ("Global Assembly Cache").  Instead, you should 
deploy the appropriate FSharp.Core as part of your application.  

### Do *not* assume any specific version of FSharp.Core is in the GAC, even if it is on your machine

Once again, do not rely on FSharp.Core being in the GAC.  For applications (see above), 
use ``<Private>true</Private>`` for the FSharp.Core reference in the project file (see below). In the Visual Studio IDE this is equivalent to setting the `CopyLocal` property to `true`  properties for the `FSharp.Core` reference.

On some installations of F#, some versions of FSharp.Core are added to the GAC.  Do not rely on these
being present in production code being deployed off your machine.

There _are_ some exceptions to this.

* Standard installations of F# tools on Linux and Mac on  Mono also install the latest FSharp.Core into the
  GAC. They also add machine-wide binding redirects for that component. That means that, for those machines, the latest installed FSharp.Core will be used by applications.
  
* Some installations of F# on Windows Visual Studio and Mono did install FSharp.Core into the GAC. 

  - VS2010 installs FSharp.Core 4.0.0.0 only
  - VS2012 installs FSharp.Core 4.3.0.0 only
  - VS2013 installs FSharp.Core 4.3.1.0 only
  - VS2015 installs FSharp.Core 4.4.0.0 only
  - VS2017 __doesn't__ install FSharp.Core to the GAC

  If you can assume a particular version of Visual Studio (e.g. in a dev/test situation), then you may
  be able to assume FSharp.Core is in the GAC.  

But it is best to avoid this assumption and instead make sure an appropriate FSharp.Core
is deployed as part of your application.  

### Do *not* use an implicit FSharp.Core from a shared Xamarin mobile framework

In some versions of Xamarin tooling, an older version of FSharp.Core is in the shared framework, especially for iOS.
You should not use this version, and instead have an explicit reference to an FSharp.Core nuget pacakage in your iOS project.

### If you reference FSharp.Core, you may need to reference System.Numerics

FSharp.Core doesn't have a strong binary dependency on System.Numerics (i.e. big-integer support).

However, for some deployments of F# code (e.g. Xamarin mobile apps) you may need to add an explicit reference if it is not present already.

### What to do for error "Could not load file or assembly FSharp.Core, Version=4.0.0.0" or similar

The normal way to resolve this is to  deploy FSharp.Core as part of your application, see above. See also [this stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24801302/could-not-load-file-or-assembly-fsharp-core-version-4-0-0-0-azure-web-role) and many other similar answers on the web.

Earlier versions of F# (Visual F# 2.0) had a "runtime redistributable" you could install on target machines.  This model is now no longer used and instead you deploy FSharp.Core as part of your application.


## Reference Material:  `FSharp.Core` Entries in Project Files

By default, Visual Studio, Xamarin Studio and other tools generate well-formed F# `.fsproj` project files which
reference FSharp.Core in an appropriate way for the purpose that the component serves.  However, when using F# in 
advanced ways (and especially in cross-platform and portable scenarios) it can be useful to understand the
appropriate project file entries.  Additionally, in some F# projects the project file may have been edited by hand.  
In these cases it becomes essential to ensure you are referencing FSharp.Core properly.

There are old-style project files and new-style ".NET SDK" project files.

### New-style project files: Use ``PackageReference`` (unless using Paket)

When using new-style .NET SDK project files, Just add:

    <PackageReference Update="FSharp.Core" Version="4.3.3" />

or another appropriate version, see above.

### New-style F# project files: Use ``TargetFSharpCoreVersion``

It is normal for all F# components to define the property TargetFSharpCoreVersion:

```
    <TargetFSharpCoreVersion>4.3.0.0</TargetFSharpCoreVersion>
```

or

```
    <TargetFSharpCoreVersion>4.3.1.0</TargetFSharpCoreVersion>
```

Later in the file `FSharp.Core` will be mentioned in the actual `FSharp.Core` reference, e.g.
```
    ... Version=$(TargetFSharpCoreVersion), Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a">
```
or other variations on this.

### Old-style F# project files: Use ``AutoGenerateBindingRedirects=true`` in applications

It is normal for applications to use AutoGenerateBindingRedirects in their `.fsproj` file:

```
    <AutoGenerateBindingRedirects>true</AutoGenerateBindingRedirects>
```

This helps keep your binding redirects up-to-date when using Visual Studio and other tools that understand this property.

### Old-style F# project files: Use ``Private=True`` when referencing FSharp.Core in applications

Applications should use `Private=true` in their FSharp.Core reference. 
This is means `FSharp.Core.dll` is copied to the target directory and can be found at runtime, see above.

Libraries do not need to use this.

### Old-style F# project files: A C# project referencing an F# DLL or NuGet package may need to also have a reference to FSharp.Core.dll

A C# project referencing an F# DLL or NuGet package may need to also have a reference to FSharp.Core.dll.  This
reference must currently be managed explicitly unless you refer to the NuGet package for FSharp.Core (see below).
Using the appropriate reference text below is recommended.


### Old-style F# project files: Examples of how project files reference FSharp.Core and the F# .targets file


* *.NET 4.0, 4.5, 4.5.1, 4.5.2, 4.6.1, 4.7, netstandard1.6/2.0 etc.*. 

When using new-style .NET SDK project files, Just add:

    <PackageReference Update="FSharp.Core" Version="4.3.3" />

* *.NET 4.0, 4.5, 4.5.1, 4.5.2 etc.*. Old-style project files. For F# components restricted to run on .NET 4.x, it is normal to reference non-portable FSharp.Core using the following (adjust the FSharp.Core version number appropriately):

```
    <PropertyGroup>
       ...
       <TargetFrameworkVersion>v4.5</TargetFrameworkVersion>
       <TargetFSharpCoreVersion>4.3.1.0</TargetFSharpCoreVersion>
       ...
    </PropertyGroup>
    ...
    <ItemGroup>
       ...
      <Reference Include="FSharp.Core, Version=$(TargetFSharpCoreVersion), Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a">
        <Private>True</Private>
      </Reference>
       ...
    </ItemGroup>
    ...
    <PropertyGroup>
        <FSharpTargetsPath>$(MSBuildExtensionsPath32)\Microsoft\VisualStudio\v$(VisualStudioVersion)\FSharp\Microsoft.FSharp.Targets</FSharpTargetsPath>
    </PropertyGroup>
    <Import Project="$(FSharpTargetsPath)" Condition="Exists('$(FSharpTargetsPath)')" />
```

For components  created with earlier F# tooling (e.g. Visual Studio 2012 or before), project files may use different reference text. These should generally be adjusted to use the formulations above, this may be done automatically by some tooling.

### Old-style F# project files: FSharp.Core in Xamarin project files

FSharp.Core is referenced as a Private/CopyLocal component in Xamarin apps for mobile devices.  This reference should be done via a nuget package rather than an implicit reference.


### Old-style F# project files: Missing FSharp.Core References in .fsproj Project Files

This section deals with how .fsproj project files that are missing an FSharp.Core reference are handled by different tooling.

*Visual Studio*

If there is no `FSharp.Core` reference  in your fsproj, Visual Studio will assume an environment of "latest", i.e. whatever version it's currently running against. The generated compiler command line has no `FSharp.Core` ref in it. The compiler will make the same fallback decision (assume reference to whatever version it is running) in order to determine the FSharp.Core version it will use as target. So for F# 4.0 it will be as if you referenced `FSharp.Core, Version=4.4.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a`.

But that's where it gets tricky - the compiler actually has to resolve that version information to an assembly location. On Windows it will use MSBuild to do that resolution. With a regular install of the VF# tools on Windows, a reg key is written at `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\.NETFramework\v4.0.30319\AssemblyFoldersEx\F# 4.0 Core Assemblies` which points to the appropriate `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Reference Assemblies\...` location which should be used for compile-time resolution.  MSBuild looks at AssemblyFoldersEx when determining candidate resolution paths (that's a general MSBuild extensibility mechanism). If you whack that key, then `FSharp.Core` winds up being resolved from the GAC, and that fails due to missing optdata/sigdata.

So... for Visual Studio, the latest version of `FSharp.Core` can be obtained by inspecting the currently-executing code in Visual Studio, e.g. `fsi.exe`. But finding a suitable copy that sits next to optdata/sigdata requires outside assistance - either a reg key, a call to MSBuild or some other pointer to get you to `...\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\FSharp\.NETFramework\v4.0\4.4.0.0\FSharp.Core.dll`.





### OLD INFORMATION: Making PCL libraries

Don't. These are deprecated.

OLD INFORMATION

PCL portable libraries target a subset of .NET functionality and can be used in many different
circumstances. F# PCL portable libraries target a special FSharp.Core which is binary compatible with the final FSharp.Core used for an application (see above). The FSharp.Core numbers for PCL profiles are listed later in this guide.

In some cases you might like to make your own libraries that are PCL Portable components.
Below is a table of the recommended profiles to target depending on the minimal version of F# you can 
assume your team or other users of your library are using.

| Version | Framework       |   Recommended PCL Profile  | 
|:-------:|:---------------:|:-----------|
| F# 2.0  | .NET 4.0+       |   n/a  |   
| F# 3.0  | .NET 4.0+       |  Profile47 (net45+sl5+netcore45+MonoAndroid1+MonoTouch1) | 
| F# 3.1  | .NET 4.0+       |  Profile47 (net45+sl5+netcore45+MonoAndroid1+MonoTouch1) | 
| F# 3.1.2  | .NET 4.0+       | Profile47 (net45+sl5+netcore45+MonoAndroid1+MonoTouch1) |
| F# 4.0  | .NET 4.5+       |  Profile259 (portable-net45+netcore45+wpa81+wp8+MonoAndroid1+MonoTouch1) or Profile47 |

From the above, it can be seen that targeting F# 3.0 or 3.1 and Profile47 is a good choice for open source
libraries.  (In Visual Studio 2013, this choice is labeled as "Portable Library (.NET 4.0, Windows Store, Silverlight 5.0)" though the generated libraries can also be used with  Xamarin Android  and Xamarin iOS.)

You should always reference FSharp.Core via [the FSharp.Core nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FSharp.Core/) when preparing PCL libraries, since this will select the correct corresponding FSharp.Core version, including on Linux and OSX.

To convert an existing project to a portable profile, it may well be easiest to  edit the project file by hand.
See the project file fragments later in this guide.

See [this bug](http://visualfsharp.codeplex.com/workitem/144) for why 
profiles 7,78,259 are not recommended when using F# 3.1, even though the tooling allows their creation and consumption.

### OLD INFORMATION: Fragments of project files for portable libraries (now deprecated)

* *PCL libraries*. For F# portable PCL library components, it is normal to use the following text in the project file:

```
    <PropertyGroup>
       ...
       <TargetFrameworkVersion>v4.5</TargetFrameworkVersion>
       <TargetFrameworkProfile>Profile78</TargetFrameworkProfile>
       <TargetProfile>netcore</TargetProfile>
       <TargetFSharpCoreVersion>3.78.3.1</TargetFSharpCoreVersion>
       ...
    </PropertyGroup>

    <ItemGroup>
       ...
      <Reference Include="FSharp.Core">
         <Name>FSharp.Core</Name>
         <AssemblyName>FSharp.Core.dll</AssemblyName>
         <HintPath>$(MSBuildExtensionsPath32)\..\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\FSharp\.NETCore\$(TargetFSharpCoreVersion)\FSharp.Core.dll</HintPath>
      </Reference>
       ...
    </ItemGroup>
    ...
    <Import Project="$(MSBuildExtensionsPath32)\Microsoft\VisualStudio\v$(VisualStudioVersion)\FSharp\Microsoft.Portable.FSharp.Targets" />

```

* *Legacy PCL libraries*. "Legacy" portable projects (profile 47) use `.NETPortable` instead of `.NETCore`:


```
    <PropertyGroup>
       ...
       <TargetFrameworkVersion>v4.0</TargetFrameworkVersion>
       <TargetFrameworkProfile>Profile47</TargetFrameworkProfile>
       <TargetFSharpCoreVersion>2.3.5.1</TargetFSharpCoreVersion>
       ...
    </PropertyGroup>

    <ItemGroup>
      ...
      <Reference Include="FSharp.Core">
         <Name>FSharp.Core</Name>
         <AssemblyName>FSharp.Core.dll</AssemblyName>
         <HintPath>$(MSBuildExtensionsPath32)\..\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\FSharp\.NETPortable\$(TargetFSharpCoreVersion)\FSharp.Core.dll</HintPath>
      </Reference>
      ...
    </ItemGroup>
    ...
    <PropertyGroup>
        <FSharpTargetsPath>$(MSBuildExtensionsPath32)\Microsoft\VisualStudio\v$(VisualStudioVersion)\FSharp\Microsoft.Portable.FSharp.Targets</FSharpTargetsPath>
    </PropertyGroup>
    <Import Project="$(FSharpTargetsPath)" />
```


### OLD INFORMATION: Old version numbers

Portable PCL profiles (used at compile-time for portable libraries, can also be used at runtime when testing or as part of Windows Phone/Store apps):

|         |   4.0 |  4.5 | WinStore  |  WP8  | WP8.1  | iOS/Android  | Profile |  Version   | Moniker |
