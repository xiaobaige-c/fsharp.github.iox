## Welcome to the blog of the F# Open Engineering Group!


The mission of the F# Open Engineering group is to facilitate the development of the 
F# open edition (compiler and tools), coordinate work on high-quality libraries for F#
and support the cross-platform support for F#. 

The F# Open Engineering Group is a technical group associated with
[The F# Software Foundation](http://fsharp.org).
We manage the cross-platform and open-source [F# Compiler and Components](https://github.com/fsharp) repositories 
and the [F# Community Project Incubation Space](https://github.com/fsprojects).

Visit our [website](http://fsharp.github.io) and please continue all the great work on core F# engineering!
