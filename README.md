# F# Core Engineering Group Web

The F# Core Engineering Group is a technical group associated with
[The F# Software Foundation](http://fsharp.org).
We manage the cross-platform and open-source [F# Compiler and Components](https://github.com/fsharp) repositories. 

The group works cooperatively with major industrial and community contributors to F# to 
facilitate open-source contributions to the F# core components. For example:

* We work cooperatively with the [Visual F# Tools team](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/fsharpteam) to 
  [facilitate contributions](http://fsharp.github.io/2014/06/18/fsharp-contributions.html) to
  the F# language, compiler and library via the [Visual F# Tools repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp)

* We cooperate with the [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com) team to see F# packaged as part of the Xamarin tools for [OSX](http://fsharp.org/use/mac), 
  [Android](http://fsharp.org/use/android) and [iOS](http://fsharp.org/use/ios).

* We cooperate with the [Debian packaging team](http://packages.qa.debian.org/f/fsharp.html) to see F# packaged on Debian.
