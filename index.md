title: F# Core Engineering Activities
---

<br />

"F# Core Engineering Activities" is a loose term for activities by the people who maintain and contribute to the repositories of [The F# Software Foundation](http://fsharp.org) and [dotnet/fsharp](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp). Most work is coordinated via github issues.  These people - both maintainers and contributors - work cooperatively with major industrial and community contributors to F# to facilitate open-source contributions to the F# core components.

## Get Involved 

Please join in the fun! To get involved:

* [Contribute to the F# compiler and core library](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp)

* [Contribute to the F# RFC process](http://fsharp.github.io/2016/09/26/fsharp-rfc-process.html)

* [Contribute to other core repositories](http://github.com/fsharp) and [F# community incubation projects](http://github.com/fsprojects) and [Ionide](http://github.com/ionide)

The aim is to maintain the excellent quality of the core F# implementation across these platforms,
and to extend the set of tools available for F# across your favorite platforms.

Most discussion happens in other forums. Please use any of the following:

* [Ask questions on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/f%23/info)

* [Propose or discuss an F# language feature](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions) - please check for duplicates first

##  History

F# Core Engineering Activities dates back to 2013. The FSSF board assigns permissions and conducts oversight of the activities [through a board resolution in 2015](http://foundation.fsharp.org/core_engineering_wg).   See our original [Goals and Remit](http://fsharp.github.io/2013/07/09/group-remit.html) document.
