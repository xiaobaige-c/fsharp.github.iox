About Us
========

The F# Open Engineering Group is a working group associated with
[The F# Software Foundation](http://fsharp.org).


We manage the open-source [F# Compiler and Components](https://github.com/fsharp) repository as well
as the [F# Community Project Incubation Space](https://github.com/fsprojects).
The group also helps to facilitate open-source contributions to the F#
Language via the [Visual F# Language and Tools](https://visualfsharp.codeplex.com/) repository.


To contribute and get involved with the group activities:

* [Contribute to our core repositories](http://github.com/fsharp)

Help us bring F# to your favorite platforms,  and help us empower F# users on all platforms!
