> How Your Contributions to the F# Language, Compiler and Core Library Are Delivered Cross-Platform.

In this blog, we outline how we, the [F# Open Engineering group][fsg] (a technical working group of 
[The F# Software Foundation][fsf]) – are collaborating with the [Visual F# Tools][fst] team at 
Microsoft, Xamarin, Mono and other contributors to F# to help deliver your contributions to the 
F# Language, Compiler and Library across multiple platforms.
We encourage you both to contribute all F# open engineering efforts, and to join our group and help us!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The mission of the F# Open Engineering group is to facilitate the development of the 
F# open edition (compiler and tools), coordinate work on high-quality libraries for F#
and support the cross-platform support for F#. In this blog post, we'll have a quick
look at the recent work done by the community that falls within the remit of the Core 
Engineering group – there is a lot going on!
