title: F# Core Engineering Activities
---

<br />

"F# Core Engineering Activities" is a loose term for activities by the people who maintain and contribute to the repositories of [The F# Software Foundation](http://fsharp.org) and [dotnet/fsharp](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp). Most work is coordinated via github issues.  

These people - both maintainers and contributors - work cooperatively with major industrial and community contributors to F# to facilitate open-source contributions to the F# core components.

The activities include:

* Contributing to [The primary F# repository](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp)

* The [F# Language Design and Core Library RFC Process](http://fsharp.github.io/2016/09/26/fsharp-rfc-process.html)

* The [The #compiler channel of FSSF Slack](https://fsharp.slack.com/messages/C05325FDM)

* Maintaining the "Use F#" guides such as [Use F# on Windows](http://fsharp.org/use/windows), [Use F# on Linux](http://fsharp.org/use/linux) and [Use F# on OSX](http://fsharp.org/use/mac).

Please join in the fun!

## Goals and Remit

F# Core Engineering Activities dates back to 2013. The FSSF board assigns permissions and conducts oversight of the activities [through a board resolution in 2015](http://foundation.fsharp.org/core_engineering_wg).  

See our [Goals and Remit](http://fsharp.github.io/2013/07/09/group-remit.html) document.

##  People Involved
