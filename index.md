About Us
========

The F# Open Engineering Group is a working group associated with
[The F# Software Foundation](http://fsharp.org).
We manage the cross-platform and open-source [F# Compiler and Components](https://github.com/fsharp) repositories 
and the [F# Community Project Incubation Space](https://github.com/fsprojects).
The group also helps to facilitate open-source contributions to the F#
Language via the [Visual F# Language and Tools](https://visualfsharp.codeplex.com/) repository.
